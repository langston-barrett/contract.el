;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides a set of contracts for the 'seq' library.

;;; Code:

(require 'contract)
(require 'seq)

     (seq contract-sequence-c)

         contract-nat-number-c
         (contract-lt-c (seq-length seq))))
     ;; Slightly more specific than contract-any-c. A sequence can't be an
     ;; element of itself.
     (contract-not-c (contract-eq-c seq))))

   ;; Return the first element of SEQUENCE.
   (cons #'seq-first (contract-> contract-sequence-c contract-any-c))

   ;; Return a sequence of the elements of SEQUENCE except the first one.
   (cons #'seq-rest (contract-> contract-sequence-c contract-sequence-c))
